# Hello, I am Pidjan.
My main profession is coding.

I've been programming for 5 years now (some of the languages I know are: C++, Python, NodeJS) and I love it.

I also like to help people and understand a lot of things related to PC and know how to use Google properly. I like anonymity and speak English well.
